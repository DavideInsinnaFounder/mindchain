# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Mindchain.

This repository is currently focused on:
- conceptual scope definition
- documentation
- non-production reference skeletons

## How to Contribute
- Open an issue for: questions, feedback, improvements
- Propose documentation PRs (clarity, diagrams, missing sections)
- Suggest use-cases and constraints relevant to AI-native payments

## Notes
- Please avoid speculative token economics. Mindchain is a payment rail concept.
- The `/reference` folder is intentionally minimal and non-production.
